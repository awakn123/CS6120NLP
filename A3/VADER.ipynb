    "The columns “min”, “25%”, “50%”, “75%”, and “max” represent different percentiles and extremes in the distribution of polarity scores. These statistics help in sentiment analysis tasks by providing a comprehensive view of how sentiments are distributed across different ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "Min: The lowest polarity score, indicating the most negative sentiment within the group.\n",
    "25%: The lower quartile, where 25% of scores are below this value, showing the lower bound of sentiment scores.\n",
    "50%: The median, indicating the middle sentiment score.\n",

    "2 to 5-Star Ratings: Positive mean polarity scores indicate that reviews with higher star ratings express more positive sentiments. This trend is consistent across both VADER and TextBlob, with the mean polarity scores increasing as the star ratings increase. Correspond to higher positive mean polarities, indicating more positive sentiments.\n",

    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation for VADER polarity scores tends to decrease with higher ratings, suggesting more consistency in positive sentiment expression among higher-rated reviews. TextBlob’s standard deviation does not show a consistent trend.\n",

    "These results confirm that sentiment scores are correlated with the star ratings given by customers. For instance, a high VADER polarity score is likely to correspond to a high star rating, which can be used to predict customer satisfaction levels. Similarly, TextBlob’s polarity and subjectivity scores can provide additional layers of understanding about the reviews’ sentiments and how much personal opinion they contain.\n",
