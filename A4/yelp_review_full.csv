4,I've been going here for about 4 yrs.Cleanest nail salon I've ever been to! Everything they use on you comes out of a bag. Not all salons are sanitary which can cause health problems. I will never go to another salon again!,Salons/Barbershops
1,"We've wanted to try Thai E-San since they opened, and we finally made it down.  The ambiance is very nice.  The music was soothing and appropriate, but the food left something to be desired.  We started with the pork satay.  The pork was very good and perfectly cooked.  But the peanut sauce was bland and chalky.  I couldn't taste the peanut.  For our entr\u00e9e we ordered the Panang; Chicken with carrots in coconut milk and peanut sauce.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't like the spice that makes your food taste like lemon cleaning fluid.  Is it ginger? I don't know really.  But the Panang had a lot of it and that was all I could taste.  The service was good and the other patrons seemed to enjoy their meals, so to be fair, I would have to reserve judgment on Thai E-San until I've tried a few other things on their menu.  The problem is, we really like Thai Lahna and they aren't much further away.",Restaurants
0,The food is ok but the service is terrible!!!! Every single time we come in here it is so so so so slow!!! They really need to work on that! I see servers standing around talking while there is multiple tables with no food or drinks. SLOOOWWWWWW!,Restaurants
3,"There's typically a 15-20 minute wait when we come in on Sundays, but that's to be expected. Servers are quick and friendly, the pancakes are fluffy and have a hint of lemon zest which is so good! \n\nMy only disappointment is the limited menu. The omelets have kinda weird ingredients and are very, very rich. Before going, I'd definitely give it a once over to make sure it has something you'll like.\n\nYou get your bill and pay up at the entrance, so the turnover is pretty quick. Very good and efficient!",Restaurants
3,"Five guys offers a basic selection of burgers, sandwiches, and hot dogs, with a plethora of toppings to choose from, free of charge! You can choose between a two patty burger (The regular size), or the \""little\"" one patty size. Fries can either be plain or tasty Cajun style. \n\nI went with a \""little\"" bacon cheeseburger. Don't let the moniker fool you- there is nothing little about this burger! It was a sizable portion of beef, with fresh, tasty ingredients. We also split a medium size order of Cajun fries.\n\nI went with \""all the way\"" minus mayo, and added jalapeno. \""All the way\"" means basic ingredients you would typically find in your burger, outlined in black on the menu board. Such ingredients include mustard, ketchup, lettuce, pickles, tomato, grilled onion, grilled mushroom, and mayo. The more non-traditional toppings are outlined in red on the menu board, and include jalapeno, relish, and A1 sauce. \n\nService was fast and friendly, and my burger and fries were made in no time.\n\nThe burger was nicely grilled, and the veggies were fresh and crisp. Even the jalapeno was fresh and thinly sliced. It packed a punch! The bacon was the equivalent of 1 strip on the burger, which was cooked nice and crisp. The grilled onions were a nice addition, but if you order them on your burger don't expect a lot of caramelized flavor on them since they'll taste a little more steamed than grilled.\n\nThe fries were delicious. The Cajun spice mix dusting them were a good addition. The medium size is a good size if you are sharing with someone.\n\nThe drink fountain is the cool \""create your own\"" soda machine, with a multitude in diet and regular options. Orange flavored mello yello? Lime ginger ale? Vanilla diet barqs? Yes please!\n\nPlus, any place that plays The Ramones in their restaurant is A-OK in my book!",Restaurants
4,Good food and service. We tried a little of everything since this was our first time here.  The best part was the carne asada quesadilla.  It had so much meat and cheese.  The salsa bar is pretty legit also and it has 5 different salsas.after I selected my salsa the nice cashier lady came over and brought me a bag to put them in so they didn't spill.  Next was the bean and cheese burrito enchilada style.  The carnitas weren't that great but they weren't bad.  The carne asada taco was good but Would of been better With some avocado and less onion.  If you're in the area you should for sure Check them out.,Restaurants

Menu appears to have some decent options.\nMy fail was to combine some toppings on the burger that just didn't blend well.  I don't understand.  Blue cheese, spinach, tomatoe, and onion is GREAT as a salad.  On top of a burger it was blech.  \nBurger was well done, as in overcooked.

1,"So a little background information I'm from Indiana/Kentucky and I've been to numerous Goodwills throughout those 2 states.  \n\nThis one is exactly DOUBLE the price of the stores out east.  All dresses here are $10 and they were always and I mean always $5  where I'm from, even amazing glitterama dresses.  I have one such dress that I bought that I could probably easily sell for a few hundred dollars if I fix the small tatter at the bottom.  Granted there were never any sales back home just a great value everyday of the week, which I prefer over madhouse shopping on 50% off days which is actually just bringing you to the fair price that most every other Goodwill in America charges (I can't speak for California).  \n\nWhich brings me to the question, Why does the Valley try to scam poor or poorer people so much?  I break it down to supply and demand.  There are just so many people on a shoestring budget that they are able to bring up the prices the demand is so great for thrifty items.  It is a little out of hand though here in the valley at ALL thrift stores.  It probably has been this way for a long time so no one really has a comparison of what a thrift store should cost.  \n\nI will save my money and shop at the plethora of yard sales before I go to these rip off thrift stores.",Home Services
4,"The Main Ingredient is one of those downtown staples that I used to visit every week when I lived just around the corner. My favorite sandwich is the Jive Turkey (it's ridiculously good), followed by the Cash Money (yum). The chips and salsa are also worth noshing on.\n\nOnce famous for the Gordon on their drink menu, they have mixed it up a bit with the Gordon equivalent G'Knight. I'm not sure if they're back to serving Gordon yet, but if so, do it! TMI also has the best Happy Hour in town on Mondays.\n\nIf you're just there for drinks with a friend, grab the tiny sofa! If you're there with a bunch of friends, snag an outside patio table; it's casual and the best place to have conversation. It's also extra fun when it gets colder in the fall---they bring out the firepits!\n\nAll in all, this is one of the best places to have a tasty casual meal in downtown. Grab a beer and enjoy!",Restaurants
3,"A nice theatre with big screens and clean, comfy seats. It's now a Cineplex Odeon, but the AMC logo is still up on the building outside.\n\nThe main ticket area is an open space homage to hockey, which is cool, except it's so dim you're liable to think a few lights went out and need replacing. The up escalator is also currently out on the bottom floor, so you feel stuck and stupid coming out of your movie until you're able to find the elevator by the condiments station.\n\nThe Forum is one of the few theatres nearby with an IMAX screen, but know that this is a digital IMAX which means it's a 20% bigger screen, not a \""true\"" IMAX.

The stylist MINDI chopped my nice bob so bad, that it didn't look like a bob anymore when I left.  My hair now looks very choppy and uneven.  She totally mishaped the bob.  Unfortunately there is nothing I can do but to let it grow out.

The person at the cash register left and no one else stepped in eventhough there were two other staff in the cash register area.  I don't mind waiting but being ignored is another matter.  Earlier on in my visit, I thought this would be a good place to bring my daughters, but by the time I left, any cozy notions of returning to Chocolaterian with others were dashed.  It would be embarassing to bring companions there only to be ill-treated by staff. There are plenty of other local places in Madison to go that are dependable.",Restaurants
1,"We ordered the mushroom burger w/sweet potato fries and off the light menu the veggie wrap w/salad. Also a side of onion rings. Our order was messed up, but that doesn't bother us as long as the food is good. Plus the guy that took our order was very apologetic and gave good service. I want to believe it is just this location that the food was disappointing. For the price, you would expect high quality food and it was the complete opposite. The $10 burger patty did not taste or look fresh (frozen patty??) and was a bit on the rough side (med.well, but it's ground beef!) and salty. The veggie wrap was more of a lettuce wrap because that is what I can taste the most of, even though it had other roasted veggies. The sweet potato fries were ok and the onion rings were good. The greens for the salad and burger also did not look fresh. Will not be going back to that location and will give Rachel's another chance at a different location.

2,"Preface: Sunflour has recently found itself under new ownership so I waited to write this review until I went back a few times. \n\nReview: I am very conflicted with Sunflour right now. I loved this bakery for their sandwiches, the treats, the coffee, and definitely the laid back but adorable atmosphere. They have Counter Culture coffee, which I really enjoy, so the coffee is a great draw. Their treats still seems to look good - they have a great array of cupcakes (the Carrot Cake is fantastic but there are some I still need to try!), many types of muffins (the Morning Glory is holy), and other types of treats from whoopie pies, cake, pie, tarts, cinnamon buns, cheddar biscuits, croissants, scones, and basically anything else a great bakery should have. \n\nThey have great options for breakfast and lunch sandwiches; I am a fan of their 'TAB' (turkey, avocado, bacon). They also have this Rosemary Sourdough bread that is, for seriousness, off the chain. I always want to buy it to take home but I know for a fact I would eat it in one sitting with zero hesitation; so I refrain. \n\nClearly, I enjoy their food. However, the food is nothing if the service behind it is not up to par. I don't know what is happening, and I made sure I came twice over a decent amount of time under new ownership to let them work out their kinks, but the service has become extremely below average. The place always had a slower pace, and even though I'm an instant gratification person, I accepted it and enjoyed it for what it was because it was still reasonable. \nThe second to last time my boyfriend and I came, we ordered two sandwiches and one coffee, and we could tell the girl behind the counter was not focusing and I was already preparing for a slip up. Well, 10 minutes later, no coffee, she caught me looking and literally gasped \""oh no!\"" She brought us two coffees and said \""I am so sorry I forgot.\"" Meh. Strike one but thank you for the extra coffee. 15 minutes after that (so 25 minutes after ordering) we still had not gotten our sandwiches and noticed plenty of others had. Finally we mentioned it to a different person at the counter and they were legitimately surprised, realized they were never ordered (strike two), had our sandwiches instantly made and brought out to us. We were annoyed but just happy to have our food. To our surprise, the man at the counter told the manager who came out, spoke to us, apologized, explained the new ownership and employees, refunded us our meal and gave us additional coffees. I was very impressed with their acknowledgment and amends to the mistake. We ate our food and chalked it up to a bad day. \n\nWe came back again this afternoon, to a pretty empty bakery (maybe two or three other people), ordered two sandwiches and two coffees. We got our coffees quickly (a little burnt but not ruined), then our sandwiches came out. Mine was not as ordered (stroke three) so I asked them to please fix the sandwich. They apologized (the sandwich maker missed the line of what to leave out), and brought out a new one. It was again not as ordered (strike four), so I brought it back up, she apologized again, offered a free cookie, and brought it back out again as ordered. \n\nEpilogue: All in all, the food is still good but this place has dwindled quite a bit in my book and clearly has a lot of kinks to work out with the communication from front to back of house. Four me, four strikes is enough to hesitate returning back here, which truly makes me very sad.",Restaurants

Nice tea flavor but duck was a bit dry.\n\nStir Fried Chinese Vegetables - it was probably the best dish of the bunch, but then again, if you can't stir fry vegetables, then it's pretty sad.\n\nBeef Noodle Soup -  broth was way too sweet. You do get good amount of beef and noodles though, but the flavor is just OK.\n\nFried Pork Chop Rice - the pork chop was good but all it came with on the plate was the pork chop, some pickled daikon and rice. What happen to the soy-sauce egg and some sauteed veggies that usually comes with pork chop rice??\n\nEel Rice - A small piece of eel (4\"" wide) on top of a rice with pickled daikon. Not impressed for $10 dish!

The horrid 90's revamp of a 50's diner with pig kitsch look of the place makes it impossible for me to take it seriously or to feel ok about eating there but we have had take out a few times.   The sides are really, meh, you are better off going across the street to \""Sprouts\"" grocery and buying their potato salad and slaw and whatever else you like there to have with your smoked meat.  Their meat is really basic.  If you buy Guy Fierei's bottled sauce at the grocery store and you buy all of your sides at the grocery store and then get some smoked meat from Thee Pitts you can have a relatively unremarkable but not terrible meal.  I prefer the smoked stuff from Bobby Q and from Rudy's, sadly Rudy's is all the way in Chandler but when I want smoked meat either I smoke it myself or I drive to Chandler anymore.",Restaurants
0,"I gave this place three chances over the years and each time I was disappointed so I am officially DONE! The latest event: had a slow leak in a tire, called and was told to come on in. I explained that there was no visible reason for the leak so it needed to be removed from the rim and further examined. I arrived and was treated rudely by a man who acted as if I was putting him out by being there and asked \""who told you you could just come in\""? A mere 15 minutes later he came into the GROSS lobby and told me nothing was wrong with the tire, it was fine. I knew that was false but wanted to get my five year old and myself out of there! So I went to TOWER TIRE in Aspinwall and they rock and did the right thing, finding the pin hole and fixing it for $10.70! \nThree chances is enough for me!

4,"Amazing Place. Excellent service. Starting with the Veggie Spring Rolls which were good, but the accompanying sauce that just gave a suggestion that it was sweet and sour pulled the whole starter to the next level. For dinner we ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and the Pineapple Rice (both medium hot which proved to be just right). The Pad Thai was authentically delicious and the Pineapple Rice unexpectedly surprised with a few big shrimps, chicken, and tofu, but nevertheless, was uniquely tasty. The Pumpkin curry on the $5 menu is a must order. We also enjoyed sticky rice with fresh ripe mango and a not too sweet milk. The whole experience was perfect. Nicely decorated modern atmosphere with an obvious Thai theme. Clean restaurant and bathroom. What more could you ask for. We will definitely be going back for more! In the buzz and influence of a belly fully satisfied with wonderful Thai food, my husband even declared Thai food as his new favorite cuisine!",Restaurants

But the pizzas are phenominal with top notch toppings and worth the $10. That pretty much goes for everything in there. It costs a little more than other places but you get what you pay for. The salads are fresh and delicious with not too much dressing which is very important to me. The chicken, pine nut and gorgonzola salad is awesome. I usually get the chicken pesto pizza which is just delicious. I totally recomend this place especially for lunch.",Restaurants
0,"If I could give Alaska Airline 0 stars I would. With all of the Airlines that i have flown with, my worst experience would be with this Airline.  First, our flight was canceled in Seattle so we decided to call reservation while waiting to  talk to a customer service agent in person.  I was a little hesitant with the customer service agent because I saw the way she was servicing the person before us. Of course no smile, no nothing, she dreaded our existence as if she did not want to be working. I asked her about our flight and she had no clue it was canceled due to maintenance, she basically told us she couldn't help us so i ask for a supervisor. The supervisor at the station had the worst attitude in customer service that I have ever encountered, believe me when i said that i stayed calm the whole time.  The supervisor did not know the reasoning for the canceled flight either until she paged someone. Her rude attitude was no acceptable. We had an event the moment we land and had to be in the Las Vegas Convention center right after so our urgency to get on the next flight was not a concern to them. I asked if it was possible to get on the next available flight or another airline, they did not want to help, they did not give us any options, no nothing. Noted the cancellation was due to maintenance and not weather related but they felt like they don't have to take ownership for it.  As to many other airlines they understand that maintenance is under their control and would find ways to help their customers.  The reasoning for not helping us was of course we are not a \""diamond member, as she stated something close to that.  We asked if it's possible to put us on stand by for the next flight, she finally did, and after we took a few steps away form the counter we heard the supervisor gossiping about the situation, yes very professional.   Feeling uneasy about the experience, the night before leaving Vegas we got down to the conference room in our hotel building  and realized they had screwed up our flight coming back from Vegas to Seattle. Of course, with the service and screw up they have given us in Seattle, we were not surprise at all. When we called reservations they tried to place the blame on something else! What a sh!t show. Alaska Airline can not take ownership of their own companies fault, they pass it around to anything that they could to make their company hold that image of being the better airline.  The no good agent and supervisors in the Seattle Airport was a joke, Please fire them. Terrible work ethic and customer service.  They represent your company and if this is the face of Alaska Airline why should we choose your mileage card compared to other Airlines? Especially with Alaska Airline's terrible service? We shared this information inside the Las Vegas Convection Center with several people and will be sharing this terrible service to many more, for even though we are not your \""Diamond members\"" we are still your customers. We made the mistake of choosing your mileage program this past year. and now we know better. We know we fly frequently enough to know better that service should not be this terrible.  It was a big surprise for us due to the fact that Alaska Airline should be one of the best and from this experience, it was the worst out of the 8 flights i have taken this year.",Travel & Tourism

2,COMPED ROOM - MARDI GRAS TOWER\n\nLast month I comped 4 free nights at Bally's. The room at Bally's was spacious. There were two things I didn't like at Bally's. First the pool was closed due to the season. Second the bridge from Bally's to The Cromwell was closed. \n\nI was excited that I was able to comp 4 free nights at Harrah's. When I checked in Monday I was given a room at the Mardi Gras Tower. To my disbelief I was shocked how small the room was. This room looked like a closet that was expanded. The room was so cramped as it appeared the bed was squished between the wall and balcony. The worst part of the room was it was located on the Strip where music was playing at the Carnival Court. When I tried to go to sleep at night I had to use earplugs. I enjoyed the vuvuzela sound four years ago at World Cup in South Africa than the noise from the Strip at night.\n\nThe reasons I didn't give a smaller rating were that I comped a room and swam at the pool.,Hotels

Its good to get away from the shoulder barging public in edinburgh (they must mean it, I'm pretty hard to miss) to enjoy the contrast of the peace available in a church.\n\nI've been in here a couple of times and it has always impressed. Like most small churches P's&G's is fairly innocuous from the outside. All grey, square and turrety.\n\nBut inside is quite stunning. A lot money has clearly been spent refurbishing the place. It has all new pine floors and cushioned(!) seats. It looks very modern whilst it retains its original features. The stained glass windows are beautiful and the pipe organ and altar look very stately. Unlike a lot of churches it is warm and bright, all the walls are white which makes the place look a lot less like a cave than other similarly aged churches. \n\nThe thing with churches is to appreciate them you have to go inside. The banality of the outside makes you think the inside will be the same. What look like plain grey windows come to life with vibrant colours. Definetly one of my favourite artforms, stained glass is disgracefully underused. \n\nThey have successfully combined the old and the new in an interesting and tasteful way.

0,"This is a follow-up review to my original one star review. As you can see my rating hasn't change, I was really hoping it would. But, unfortunately I cannot in good faith increase my star rating or delete my review after the irate conversation with the owner Lindsay Smith. \n\nAs you read in my original review, after purchasing a booklet of deals I had a horrible experience. When I tried coming in for my second appointment, I was disappointed once again. Now, you could very easily ask why I would ever make a third appointment, well that's simple, my services were already paid for and after complaining three times (on the phone, via Facebook and in person) I was assured I would not have the same stylist as my first two visits. I understand that just because the salon hired one guy who can't cut hair and is extremely rude, that doesn't mean the rest of the staff is that way. So, I scheduled an appointment for Saturday, Feb 1st.  \n\nOn the Thursday prior I received a call from the owner asking me why I scheduled an appointment after leaving a one-star review (2 weeks prior). I explained that I had essentially already \""pre-paid\"" for my services and that I was going into my appointment with an open mind. I was hoping I would leave with fantastic hair and would then be more than happy to rewrite my review. Lindsey didn't see it that way. She made it very clear she wanted that review removed, claiming it was \""unfair\"" for her. I told her I could not just remove my review because she asked me to, that I would be happy to change it after my appointment or if she made things right and just refunded what I paid for my booklet. She explained she was canceling my appointment, that she did not want me in my salon simply because I gave her a negative review and said she would contact the third party I purchased my booklet from for a refund. \n\nLindsay called me again that night to remind me I no longer had an appointment (I heard you the first time) and that she spoke with the third party and I would NOT be getting a refund. She insisted I remove my review since in her opinion it was slander, claimed she had already talked to her attorney about this. Well guess what, you can't bully someone into removing a review you don't like!!! She repeatedly blamed me for being in this situation, saying I should have contacted her. However, I informed her salon of my problem on 3 separate occasions, it is NOT my fault if your staff does not inform you there was a problem and you have a client that's extremely upset. The fault lies with your staff not informing a manager like they stated they would, it lies with your stylist whom I wouldn't let groom a homeless dog and you for having NO clue how to run a business. Based on the filtered 1-star reviews I'm not the first to be dissatisfied and unfortunately I will likely not be the last. \n\nTo cancel my appointment simply because you do not like my review is not very professional (or mature), a real business owner would have wanted me to come back in to show me that her company is better than this. Instead, (to no surprise) she threw a fit and hung up on me when I refused to delete my review. Very unprofessional!! \n\nIn the end, I never got my money back. She claims that the $50 I spent on the booklet was less expensive than a $65 hair cut there, which would make sense if I had actually left with a decent haircut and didn't have to go elsewhere for it to be fixed. \n\nAdditionally, they are advertising services they do not have. The booklet included services for a manicure and a pedicure but for months I have been unable to schedule one because they cannot seem to keep a nail tech on staff...I wonder why??\n\nOne more thing, please read the previous 5 star reviews. Some are employees (they said so in their review) and others are clearly either friends of the salon or work there themselves. There are too many reviews where this is their only review. They don't have a yelp photo, didn't complete their profile, don't have any friends and this is their only review. Seems mighty suspicious to me. But, if that's how Lindsey feels she needs to portray her business, she's only hurting herself.",Salons/Barbershops

Place seem to attract seedy types makes me feel like I live in belleview. Finally place has a scent that rivals Jeffery dahmers old apartment. They need to smile more and lighten up on there indifferent attitude or I go to blockbusters and take business with me. P.S. This place prays on you with bogus late fees and DVDs that have a fingerprint on them, they also up charge you on expired candies bought from the dollar store and over priced soft drinks that you can by at bashas for a lot less. And how do you not carry boogie nights on DVD I mean really?????!!! \n\nSigned,\n\nRock star superstar.",Restaurants
3,"Good service, good food, good beer, and textbook Americanized Irish pub feel.  If I have to go to Boca Park for happy hour, this is where I usually try to steer the event.  I like the laid back atmosphere and playing a little keno while I sip my Guiness.\n\nNot much else to tell...",Restaurants
1,"The quality of the food here is pretty consistent and good BUT the last few trips to Sauce in Chandler have produced meals that are barely warm and the portion size has shrunk to the size of a kids meal. :(  Unfortunately, tonight we had to send two meals back - both were lukewarm at best.",Restaurants
1,"We arrived at approximately 8:15pm on a Saturday night and wanted to sit outside. The person greeting us proceeded to tell us that they had just closed the patio, due to a holiday weekend so that the staff could leave early.  We were concerned about keeping people, so we were ready to leave, when she adamantly stated that we could still be served.  I specifically told her that we did not want to keep them from closing early.  She insisted, and so we were seated inside.  Halfway through our meal, which was approximately 30 minutes, servers were blowing out candles on surrounding empty tables, and a sense of urgency upon our server and assistants, to clear and move us along was extremely evident.  Our entire table consisted of restaurant management and service industry individuals, and this was extremely annoying to all of us.  We requested a manager, and he arrived at our table without an introduction.  He offered an apology, told us to stay as long as we wanted, and walked away.  Really???  Work on your attention to customer service Dolce.  You may pay an admirable amount of attention to your pasta, but you have a lot to work on when it comes to customer service.",Restaurants

The experience started with NO HOST at the entrance -- hmm, are we suppose to seat ourselves? But why do they have a host booth? Finally someone came to help us get settled. I requested for a table with booth since our kids manage to fall off any regular chair whenever we're at a restaurant coz of their non-stop playing while waiting for the food. The spacing between tables were TOO CLOSE. You could literally hear the next table's conversation even if you don't intend to do so. We were given menu but the waiter too forever to get our order because he was too busy flirting with a bunch of customers who came in way later than we did. When he did finally get our order, he was in so much hurry. I had to ask him to repeat what I said just to make sure he got what I ordered. \nThe waiting time was OKAY. But guess what, the other table who came later & ordered later than we did GOT THEIR FOOD FIRST! Really dude?! Really..I wanna just get up and leave but I we waited too long & too hungry to leave. Thinking the food was gonna be good, we stayed -- but IT WAS A DISASTER!! Man! We should've just walked away!! My pasta was too salty & the steak was too tough. Our son's tilapia with pilaf rice & the 2 dozen raw oysters were the only decent food on the table. I am never going back again. Staff needs to get retrained on proper costumer care & HOW TO PRIORITIZE clients. Prices were too steep for the quality of food we ordered. Stay away. Too overrated.",Restaurants
2,"I had been to Chic Nails once before.  They have great hours and generally you can always walk in and not wait.  We went to Chic Nails today because they do offer Gel nail polish and my friend wanted Gel.\n\nI believe the owner is the older gentleman and I was with the daughter.  I got a standard manicure and my friend got Gel.  The manicure was nice, the girl was gentle, but could have cleaned up the hang nails a little better.  There was an older woman there doing pedicures and she took over painting my nails from the young girl.  I don't know who the older lady was, -- But she was AWESOME.  You can tell who painted which hand.\n\nPrice was spot on, I paid $12 for a manicure and left $!0 in a tip.  I wish I had not worn jeans or I would have gotten a pedicure as well.  There pedicure chairs look really nice and each has a pillow.\n\nProps to the magazine selection.  They had all the recent issues of fashion and gossip rags.  Also they must have 200 colors to pick from.  OPI, China Glaze and a couple other brands.\n\nI would definitely go back, the only wish is the mani chairs are line against the wall, so if you are with a girlfriend they sit in front of you not next to you.\n\nPS they DO NOT WAX - I am in dire need of an eyebrow wax.\nPSS this is the nail place along 44th that I have found that takes AMEX",Salons/Barbershops
